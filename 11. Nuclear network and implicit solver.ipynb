Runge-Kutta is an example of a higher-order scheme that evaluates approximately the RHS at yet to be determined locations of the next time step. In the coupled network equation encountered in this example the problem is not just overall accuracy, but the fact that the rate coefficient are different by orders of magnitude. The p capture of $^{15}N$ is 5 orders of magnitude faster than the p capture of $^{14}N$, and the result is a fast decline initially of $^{15}N$ that dictates the time step for the entire calculation.

For the purpise of root finding for _one_ timestep $n$ does not change. \n",

This is done until the termination condition $\\delta < \\delta_\\mathrm{max}$ is satisfied,  where $\\delta_\\mathrm{max}$ a user-set parameter to control precision.

The odeint library implements a higher-order solution which lies inbetween.\n",
