    "# 2. Distributed version control system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this course we will share lecture notes, assignments, problem sets, exams etc. in the same way software development teams do. In any such team it is important not only to share pieces of code and other information but to attribute it, and to document when and where work has been added and changes have been made. In this way the team can review changes to a previous version, find bugs and easily use and relate to previous versions. Another advantage is that everybody can make changes to their own copy while other developers work on other parts, and later these branches of development can be merged back into a common code base. We will adopt the _distributed version control system_ [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).\n",

This is not to be confused with the commercial GitLab server  [https://about.gitlab.com](https://about.gitlab.com).

    "\n",
    "You will need to create your own private course repository (repositories are called _projects_ in GitLab) called `mp248`. Then _share_ the project with the instructors to give them read and write access. This private repo will contain your assignments, quizzes, exams, as well as your own course notes and examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Update the course repository\n",
    "When the course instructor has made changes to the course repository you need to get thos updates into your Jupyter instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You have already cloned the course repository in the first Lab. But you did not yet have your ssh keys set up. When you suspect your instructor has made a change use `git pull` to update your repo; `git pull` is doing two things in sequence that at some point you may decide to do separately\n",
    "    - first it does `git fetch` which updates your local repo with all information from the remote,but it does not change any file on your active branch (I explain below what a branch is)\n",
    "    - second it performs a `git merge` which does update files in your current branch\n",
    "    - for the course repo using `git pull` is entirely appropriate because you would not add anything yourself, and `merge` really means _just add the new things_\n",
    "* You would have maybe tried out some notebooks and done some tests to your cloned course repo. Then after the next class you do `git pull` to update your version of the course repo. But since you have modified some files since last time git would refuse to pull the new version as this would potentially overwrite some of your changes. There are two or three ways to deal with this:\n",
    "    1. instead of modifying the notebooks in place, create a `notes` dir in your own course repo, copy the notebook files for the current class there, and make your notes, try out things and customize. Then, commit these versions to your own repo for save keeping and future record.\n",
    "    2. Do what git tells you to do: `git stash` [_stashes away_](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash) your changes, they are somewhere and could be recovered later if needed. Git now will pull the latest version from the remote.\n",
    "    3. `git checkout _changed file_` will replace the modified version of _changed file_ with the _unchanged file_ from last commit. This will allow git to pull the latest version. `git checkout .` will do the same for all files in your repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Add new files to your own repository\n",
    "Once your own repo is in place the typical workflow involves:\n",
    "* `git add` to stage files you have newly created or modified for the next `commit` to the index\n",
    "* `git commit` creates a snapshot of the repo as it is staged in the index\n",
    "* `git push` will move the snapshot and the repo info to the remote repo on our GitLab server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowing what is going on in your repo and housekeeping\n",
    "The single most important command is \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows the status of your repo, and will tell you which files are not under version control yet, which ones are changed, and which branch you are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GitLab server provides a visual representation of the repo tree (with the various branches if there are any, see below). Check the _Repository_ menu item, second from top, left menu bar. On the command line the equivalent information can be obtained with\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git log --all --oneline --decorate --graph\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may produce scratch files and other unwanted things in your repo, such as checkpoint files, log files etc. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clean\n",
    "``` \n",
    "removes all files that are not under version control. Use with options `-i` (interactive), `-n` (dry run), `-d` (directory) and `-f` (force). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your own sandbox\n",
    "At this point it may be useful for training purpose to create a sandbox repo, i.e. something you can mess around with and do not care about. Make a directory in your Jupyter instance and change into that directory. The command `git init` will turn that directory into a git repository. Create a file, add, commit. Check the result with `git status` or with the useful commands introduced below. You can also create a sandbox repo on our GitLab server and clone it to your Jupyter instance. You can delete it later, or not. "

    "### Creating a new Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally when you create a folder, it is just a place to hold files; the git system doesn't treat this folder as special. It is possible to take any directory that already contains some files and convert it to a git repository (see the [Pro Git book](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for documentation). But for this course the recommended way is to use the _New project_ functionality on the GitLab server, remember to tick the box to add a `README.md` file, and then clone the newly created repository to your local Jupyter instance. \n",

    "```bash\n",
    "cd foldername\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(If that folder isn't created, create it. Note: This should NOT be the same name as the repository name. This is the folder you want to work in, kind of like the Documents folder on Windows and Mac - it is where you store your projects, NOT the name of the project itself.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The repository needs to know which files are part of the coding project, and which files are just dummy files that are there for their own purposes. If you create a new file in the  repository directory, it is not automatically added to the git system.

    "```bash\n",
    "git commit\n",
