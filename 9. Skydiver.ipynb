    "\n",
    "A falling body - say a skydiver - will increase speed when she jumps off the plane because she is accelerated by the earth's gravity. However, the speed will not increase forever. In addition to the gravitational force the sky diver will feel the drag force due to air resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the terminal velocity of the sky diver? This will depend on the balance of two forces: the gravitational force and the drag force that describes the air resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation of motion\n",
    "The equation of motion for the velocity is $v = a t +v_0$ where $a$ is the acceration and $v_0$ the initial velocity. But this is of course just a special case of the more general case\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = \\sum \\vec{F}_i .$$\n",
    "where $\\vec{p}$ is the momentum and $\\vec{F}_i$ is one of several forces that may act, like gravitational force and friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forces\n",
    "We will consider a 1D motion in the vertical direction, and therefore consider the scalar equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gravity\n",

    "$$F = - m g$$\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass of the body and $g$ is the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration.\n",

    "#### Air drag\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain an idea of what a formula for the air drag could be we use dimensional analysis. This method is based on the principle that every physics equation must be dimensionally homogeneous, i.e. the units on each side of the equation must be the same. We are looking for a force, which has the unit \n",
    "$$ [F] = \\frac{ML}{T^2}$$\n",
    "where $M$, $L$ and $T$ stand for the mass, length and time unit. We then consider what the drag force could possibly depend on. This consideration is where the physics happens. We expect that the drag force will somehow depend on the following:\n",

    "We are looking for an expression of the type\n",
    "$$F = C_D \\rho^a v^b A^c$$ \n",
    "where $C_D$ is a dimensionless coefficient and $a$, $b$ and $c$ are derived from the condition that unit of $F$ has to come out correctly. You can easily confirm that this is the case if $a=1$, $b=2$ and $c=1.$ Convention has it that we throw in another factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the  resulting expression for the drag force is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_D = \\frac{1}{2} C_D \\rho v^2 A.$$ \n",

    "### Drag coefficient\n",

    "A number of hydrodynamic processes contributed to the total drag of a an object. Which of these will dominate will depend on the flow regime. Flow regimes in hydrodynamics are characterized by dimensionless numbers. The relevant number in our case is the Reynolds number $$Re = \\frac{l v}{\\nu}$$\n",
